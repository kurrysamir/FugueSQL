# FugueSQL

Business Analysts who make a transition to Data Science, one thing that disturbs them is to learn a programming language like Python. They are inclined towards writing a lot of SQL statements, but it is a bit challenging for them to learn a new technology just so that they can play around datasets using pandas.
There is an amazing package that helps you write SQL statements on your pandas dataframe.

Fugue is a unified interface for distributed computing that lets users execute Python, pandas, and SQL code on Spark and Dask without rewrites. It is meant for:

* Data scientists/analysts who want to focus on defining logic rather than worrying about execution.
* SQL-lovers wanting to use SQL to define end-to-end workflows in pandas, Spark, and Dask.
* Data scientists using pandas wanting to take advantage of Spark or Dask with minimal effort.
* Big data practitioners finding testing code to be costly and slow.
* Data teams with big data projects that struggle maintaining code.
* People very pro-efficient with SQL can stick to SQL and use pandas along with SQL.
